# Predictor
This is an independent minimodule for learning periodical waveforms. Model must be trained with input data, which can be generated e.g. running `generate_data.py`. Generated data can be first viewed with `plot_data.py` before starting training with `train.py`. Training progress can be occasionally checked by viewing plots in `predictions/` folder.

Config file provides many options to tweak the problem that model is trying to solve. Check the `config.py` for additional information.
